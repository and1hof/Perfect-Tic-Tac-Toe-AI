# Perfect-Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
An optimal tic-tac-toe agent which should always win, or at worst tie in any given game.

### PREREQUISITES
A JavaScript-enabled web browser is all that is needed to play this variation of tic-tac-toe.

### GETTING STARTED
Download the repo as a .zip, unzip it on your desktop and double-click the index.html.

### USAGE
The AI agent itself is contained within the "tictactoeAgent.js" file.

### WHATS IMPLEMENTED
- Agent always wins, utilizing heuristics as described in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe programming guide.
- Because it utilizes heuristics rather than recursive algorithms, the AI runs very fast.

### TODO
- Perhaps include a minimax-based variation on this AI. Although less efficient, it would be interesting to compare the two.
